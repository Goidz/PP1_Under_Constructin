        <div class="text-intro">
            <p>Born in the murky bowels of Neukölln, Berlin.
                We have for decades fed on the sound of crushing guitar amps, stomping drums and cold beer.
                Driven by a purpose to collectively push the boundries of all genres within Rock and Metal.
                To create an open and diverse community of like-minded humans.
                Having our stage graced by many, from Little Richard, to Motörhead, to Gojira and everything in between.
                With your support The Giddy Goat marches forth in a world ever less open to musicianship.
                So, come in from the cold, raise your horns and beer and support the multitute of tallent we are lucky to have
                play here.
